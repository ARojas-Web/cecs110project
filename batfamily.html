                    <h2>The Batfamily</h2>
                    <p>Batman and his allies are commonly referred to as the Batfamily by both comic writers and comic book readers. In itself, the Batfamily has numerous storylines and characters with so much depth that DC Comics could easily make it a standalone universe. To say that they milk the success and pop culture power that Batman brings isn't totally wrong, but then again Marvel does the same with Spiderman, so companies just logically like to milk success to see more profits, it's business. It is a somewhat well-known fact that DC Comics headquarters actually has a department in their company dedicated to just Batfamily stuff ...just a fun fact. Below are a few series that I have selected to breifly point out and discuss. I have mainly chosen newer ones from the New 52 because it acts as a great jumping in point for new readers. But there is a large assortment of equally good stories before the reboot that are worth checking out.</p>

                        <h3>The Killing Joke</h3>
                        <p>While I did say that most of the stories on this page would be from the New 52, The Killing Joke is too iconic of a story for anyone interested in Batman to pass up. Elements of this story also carry over after the reboot with Barbara Gordon so it\'s a good idea to read this in order to further understand the psychological trauma left on Barbara (Batgirl). This story is mainly a possible origin story for the Joker. Being the psychotic madman that is, however, it is difficult to determine whether or not this the Joker is telling the truth because he even admits to not really knowing where he came from anymore. That is told through flashbacks and monologue. In the present, the Joker causes havoc and brings a great burder onto the Gordon family. The Joker's goal in this was not to kill them, however, but rather to break them so they bring out their darker sides that he shows the world everyday. The Joker acts like a devil tempting people to bring out their evil malicious traits. A worthy read and regarded as one of the best superhero stories by many people. Plus, it's only about 70 pages long, so it doesn't take a long time to get through.</p>

                        <h3>New 52 Batman</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being a decorated horror comic book writer that has worked with Stephen King and having written an amazing Batman story before the New 52 reboot, DC Comics decided to put Scott Snyder at the helm of the Batman department. The main New 52 Batman follows Bruce Wayne discovering dark secrets about Gotham and his past at times. However, this series has everything a Batman series should have: mystery, horror, action, and emotion. I do not want to give out more information than I already have here, but this is definitely worth anyone's time to read.

                        <h3>New 52 Batman and Robin</h3>
                        <p>
                            While the main Batman series focuses on building up Bruce Wayne into a more complex god-like character. Batman and Robin looks to try to humanize him by making a series about a father and son. Bruce has a child with Talia al Ghul after she drugs him and rapes him. This child is kept a secret from Bruce until she decides it is too dangerous to leave Damian (the child) near Ra's al Ghul. Damian Wayne is very stubborn and keen on killing his enemies rather than sparing their lives, but after being around the rest of Batfamily such as Dick Grayson, Tim Drake, Barbara Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth, he is shown to warm up to the idea of acting more like a superhero. Throughout the series, the bond and love between Bruce and Damian grows stronger with real love for each other being shown. There is also a heartbreaking story arc done to play off the events of <span class="italic">Batman, Incorporated</span>. Read to find out what it is and also take a look at <span class="italic">Batman, Incorporated</span>.

                        <h3>Grayson</h3>
                        <p>
                            Another series spawning from the events of <span class="italic">Batman, Incorporated</span> and also <span class="italic">Forever Evil</span>, Grayson follows Dick Grayson as he becomes a double agent at a secret organization named Spyral. Spyral is suspected to collect personal information of superheroes so Bruce Wayne asks Dick Grayson to infiltrate them and find out what is it they are actually doing and how much information they have collected. This series has a lot of light-hearted moments thanks to Dick Grayson's loose and fun nature. An easy way to understand what this series is like is to compare it to the TV show <span class="italic">Archer</span>, which has nothing to do with comic books but is a hilarious take on what it is like to be a spy. The fact that Grayson IS a comic book gives it the freedom to also be light-hearted and fun. It is perhaps one of the only series from the Batfamily that is not almost always dark.

                        <h3>Batman, Incorporated</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have mentioned Batman, Incorporated several times before and that is because it is one of the best series that also has effects on other series. Batman, Inc starts its story before the New 52 reboot and is preserved into the new continuity after the reboot. Being that Grant Morrison writes this series, DC Comics gives him the preference to tell his story without much alteration and the conclusion to this series leaves readers shocked. Batman, Inc is about a global organization started by Bruce Wayne to place a Batman/woman in several countries to combat crime on a global scale. While this is ambitious and mostly successful, there is an evil organization named Leviathan that seeks to destroy Batman, Inc and the image of Batman altogether. This series also builds up Batman into a godlike man, but at the same time tries to develop relationships between the entire Batfamily. There is enough material in this series to leave readers going over it again and again.

                        <h3>New 52 Batgirl</h3>
                        <p>
                            After being left paralyzed from the waist down and in a wheelchair, Barbara Gordon regains the mantle of Batgirl once again. During her time on the sidebench, Barbara Gordon assisted Batman and the rest of the Batfamily as Oracle -- a computer genius that can obtain just about any piece of information left on the web. But Barbara missed going out on the streets to stop criminals, so in the New 52 she underwent an expiremental surgery in Africa that allowed her to walk again. This series then deals with her learning to be Batgirl again, as well as learning to cope with the traumatic events from <span class="italic">The Killing Joke</span>. Throughout her journey in this series, she is seen to mature a lot and develop, but does not lose that special little part of her that makes her likeable and writer Gail Simone does an excellent job at finding a unique voice for Babs that blends intelligence, determination, and quirkyness.
