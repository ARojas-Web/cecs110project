                        <h3>Live Action Movies</h3>
                        <p>
                            While DC Comics does not have as many movies as Marvel, it has put out some good content in this regard. However, it would be biased to say that their track record with excellent movies. Warner Bros. has largely at fault for this because they refuse to allow writers and directors to make their visions a reality without any tampering and comic book writers do not get closely involved with movies. Even so, they have two excellent movie series that make up for their lower quality films. It's not hard to guess what they are too. See below to read a little about them and check out the video for one of the most intense and gripping scenes of all comic book live action films.

                                <div class="slide-caption">The Dark Knight Trilogy. The Dark Knight Trilogy was a huge success critically and financially. It showed the world that superhero movies do not have to be all about explosions and big fights with colorful special effects. What Christopher Nolan did was change the way the world looked at superhero movies thanks to excellent writing and acting from the entire cast. It is without a doubt, the best live action movies that DC Comics has put out, and <i>The Dark Knight</i> is perhaps the greatest superhero movie to date.</div>

                                    Wonder Woman (2017). In a time where the DCEU was inspired by The Dark Knight trilogy to make dark, serious movies there was Wonder Woman. DC and WB failed to capture what made The Dark Knight great, but Wonder Woman showed that not all their movies have to be dark, but rather what matters more is well-written characters with depth and a storyline that progresses naturally without feeling forced. Not only was Wonder Woman the first successful superhero movie with a female lead, but it is also the first truly great movie in the DCEU.

                        <h3>Animated Movies</h3>
                        <p>Where DC Comics shines brightest is in its animated films. Its animated films continously provide adaptations that are true to the source material, but add on their own touch that satisfies all viewers. Their animated films provide clear and natural character and story development. Fans and casial viewers alike can use these animated films to provide a way of jumping into comics deeper than just the live action movies because these animated films often draw from a single story arc.</p>
                        <p>Click below for a clip of one of my favorites from this series. But be warned, there are MAJOR SPOILERS for The Dark Knight Returns!</p>

                                        The Dark Knight Returns. A two-parter adaptation of the comic of the same name. This movie shows a Batman that is old and retired. He no longer puts on the cape and cowl, but then a gang called The Mutants begin threatening the city. After an attempted assault on himself from these Mutants, Bruce is pushed over the edge and reclaims his Batman suit. He gains new alliances such as Carrie Kelly and the new police commissioner, and eventually even turns the Mutants to his side. The film concludes with an epic battle between him and Superman (who is working for the US government) that inspired <span class="italic">Batman v Superman</span>. Overall, an excellent film and perhaps the most memorable film from DC's animated films.

                                        All Star Superman. An adaptatin of the comic of the same name. This follows a Superman who has his cells overcharged with solar energy that will eventually kill him. Knowing this, he tries to set his life in order and accomplish the most that he can in the time he has left. What makes this film so special is that at its base its a story of man diagnosed with a terminal disease who spends his final moments giving the most he can to humanity rather than feeling miserable or drowning himself in alcohol and women. It shows why Superman is the true definition of a superhero.

                                        Flashpoint Paradox. An adaptation of <span class="italic">DC's Flashpoint</span>. This film shows the Flash running back in time to save his mother but in doing so he creates a Butterfly effect through space and time that leaves the world altered and on the brink of collapsing in to total chaos. Atlantians and Amazonians are at war and the US government has certain heroes captive and being used as test subjects or weapons. The real standout of this movie, however, is Thomas Wayne as Batman. After seeing his son Bruce killed, he becomes a ruthless Batman who is not afraid to kill and uses guns and other lethal weapons. This film is a must-see for everyone.

                        <p>When DC Comic saw that people were crazy about comic books movies, they decided to capitilize on this trend and sprung at the chance to make TV shows that people would enjoy. The first of these major shows was <span class="italic">Arrow</span> that was release on The CW. After gaining success in both views and reviews, DC just kept expanding their number of shows to the point where there is now a surplus of them and fans of comics have more than enough to keep them happy.</p>
                        <p>Check out a little clip from one the best episodes of the DC Live Action shows. Warning: MAJOR SPOILERS for Arrow Season 5. Watch at your own risk.</p>

                                    Arrow. Arrow explodes onto the scene with a gripping pilot episode and premise. At its core, it starts off as a story of Oliver Queen dealing with a traumatic 5 years spent in a figurative hell after being shipwrecked on an island. Once a spoiled billionare playboy, Oliver must learn to survive by any means necessary and learns dark secrets about his father's past and wrongdoings. He has taken an oath to right these wrongs when he finally returns home ...which is where the first episode starts. What makes this series so gripping and entertaining is its ability to tell two storylines at once without faltering on quality (season 4 excluded, it was trash) through the use of flashback scenes that detail what went on during his 5 years in hell.

                                    The Flash. The Flash is a series about Barry Allen who was once just a forensic scientist for the Central City Police, but his life is transformed when he is bathed in chemicals and struck by lightning. He finds himself able to tap into the Speedforce which allows him to move at super speed. Being gifted with these powers allows Barry Allen to find out who killed his mother as well as helping the people of Central City. The Flash becomes a beacon of hope for everyone, but also attracts more and more supervillains rather than just theifs and muggers.

                                    Legends of Tomorrow. From pirates to circuses to time demons to immortal egyptians to dad jokes, Legends of Tomorrow has it all. This show centers around a large --and partly revoling-- cast of superheroes from the other CW superhero shows as well as their own heroes they pick up. The team of heroes are trained by Captain Rip Hunter to stop help repair errors throughout time as well as stop tyranny invisible to eye of common people; for example, a time organization that plays god and decides what every person's destiny will be. While it seems like a potentially epic show, what sets it apart from other CW DC shows is that is that it builds up meaningful relationships between each member of the Legends and makes each character special in their own way, and each season gets better and better. Definitely the most enterntaining show here, even if it is not the most epic.

                                    Lucifer. While not necessarily a show about superheroes, <span class="italic">Lucifer</span> is loosely adapted from the Vertigo Comics series of the same name, who are an imprint of DC Comics. It follows the story of the devil leaving hell behind to live in Los Angeles where he meets a detective named Chloe who he is deeply interested in but seems to have no effect over her with his devilish powers. In an attempt to get closer to Chloe, Lucifer offers his services to the LAPD as a consultant. Together with Chloe, they put away numerous criminals and Lucifer unbeknowingly becomes a much better being in the process. The series deals with themes of romance, comedy and the notion of free will, which combined make it a truly entertaining watch.
