                            <p>A blog for my comic reviews, opinions, and thoughts geared towards those looking to get their feet wet in the world of comics.</p>
                            <p>This website was made to assist in introducing people to the wonderful world of comics! One of my hobbies on my free time includes reading. Sometimes I read novels, but ever since being exposed to comics, I have become deeply fascinated with them. My interest began around the time that Marvel started laying out their cinematic universe with <span class="italic">The Incredible Hulk</span> and <span class="italic">Iron Man</span>. Even so, comics did not seem like something that I would enjoy reading. However, I was fortunate enough to be able to take a comic book class at CSULB. After doing so, I was able to see that comics can be intense, gripping, and sometimes mature pieces of literature. There are storylines and characters that are able to be fleshed out like no other form of literature can do thanks to wide continuities and new authors always bringing fresh ideas to the table. As stated before, comics have now become a great interest of mine, and the purpose of this website is to hopefully get more people reading comics. Due to the fact that I have mostly read and grown interested in DC Comics, this site consists mostly of that. </p>

                            <h3>My Preferences</h3>
                            <p>
                                To put things clearly, my main interest in comics is that of DC Comics. That's not to say that Marvel doesn't have some interesting content, but the reason that DC Comics interest me more is because I grew up watching DC cartoons. And, more importantly, what makes me geared towards DC is Christopher Nolan's <span class="italic">The Dark Knight</span> movie series that showed the world that superhero films and lore can be something truly gripping and intense. Another reason for picking DC is that their stories and characters are generally darker and more mature, which leads to more interesting developments.

                            <p>DC Comics also has their mature imprint, Vertigo Comics, which I am a huge fan of as well.</p>
