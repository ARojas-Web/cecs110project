                        <p>
                            A few of my favorite comic series here are listed and described here, but I cannot list them all at this time. Two of my particular favorites in the DC Comics Universe are Batman Family and the Lanterns, which both have a very extensive universe on their own. Due to this, I have included links to pages for these particular characters and their associated series.

                        <h3>Secret Six</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Secret Six are a team of C-List superillains (and Deadshot) are thrown together by Amanda Waller under the codename Mockingbird. They go on several missions, but along the way they really come to be a family. Each member has their own redeeming quality that makes them into more of antiheroes rather than villains after some time. And when it came to the final issue, they went down fighting together as a family. The New 52 saw a reboot of this team with some of the same core members from before the reboot. What makes this series special is it's ability to make you feel for these characters that were previously underdeveloped.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team in the original was more fleshed out, however, because the writer of series Gail Simone had the advantage of working with years of continuity from the rest of the DC universe. While many of the characters were largely unknown, they are built up and developed. For example, Catman was a joke of a villain many years before. He was a fat man who depended on solely his money and technology to try to be a challenge to Batman, but ends up being nothing more than an annoyance. With the start of this comic series, however, we see Catman transformed into someone in top physical condition with killer instincts. When not provoked, however, Thomas Blake is shown that he is reasonable and has some morals.

                        <h3>All-Star Superman</h3>
                        <p>
                            Whenever Grant Morrison is charged with writing any story, he tends to make them very whimsical and gripping. With All-Star Superman, Morrison wrote a story of Superman on the brink of dying after having his cells supercharged with solar energy. After learning that he is dying, Superman tries to set all his affairs in order, especially his life with Lois Lane; he also commits some of the best acheivements ever of mandkind, such as curing diseases with people of the Kandor and solving the unsolvable riddle from an ancient god. He even assists Lex Luthor in seeing the secret of the universe that shows how everyone is interconnected. Despite being diagnosed with a terminal fate, Superman still chooses to be a hero and give everything he can to humanity before his time is up. This selflessness shows what makes a true hero a hero and it shows why Superman is the real embodiment of hope.

                        <h3>New 52 Wonder Woman</h3>
                        <p>As mentioned before, the New 52 brought changed to the DC Universe. Wonder Woman was one of the characters greatly affected by this reboot. No longer was Diana Prince tied down to Steve Trevor, instead she was paired up with a younger, less wise Superman that spawned a different series titled <span class="italic">Superman/Wonder Woman</span>. But her own series was perhaps one of the best out of the entire lineup DC Comics had to offer with the reboot. From the first issue, you are immediately immersed and interested as to what the series will unfold in the future. The story laid out by writer Brian Azzarello follows Diana and a young woman named Zola who is carrying Zeus's child who are trying to escape the forces of the First Born (the first child of Zeus) who is trying to kill the unborn child. The child holds powers that the First Born does not want to see come to fruition so that he may take the throne of Olympus for himself; meanwhile, Zeus is absent in all this chaos and it has left the gods and demigods wondering what has happened. The tale by Brian Azarello spans through over 30 issues and sees Diana gain new allies, lose old ones, and even become a god of Olympus (read the story to find out which god she becomes). The ability to tie together Greek mythology and drama with superhero lore makes this a truly unforgettable story that deserves endless praise.</p>

                        <h3>New 52 Green Arrow</h3>
                        <p>
                            Green Arrow has always been known as a jolly, joking robin hood esque superhero. However, due the New 52 reboot, Oliver Queen was reworked as a younger billionaire that gets shipwrecked on an island alone and has to learn to survive for a year. What makes it a little different this time is that he was forced to kill, but only because that was the only way that he would ever be able to survive the hostile threats. While the New 52 Green Arrow series got off to a bad start, once writer Jeff Lemire took over, his story became an instant classic. Lemire's story arc has Oliver Queen in the middle of a war between 5 ancient clans. Each clan has a totem that grants the wielder augmented skills and some even powers. The Arrow totem is being sought after by a villain named Komodo that has ties to Oliver's past. So not only do Oliver and his allies have to stop the Outsiders War, but he also has to protect the totem from falling into the wrong hands. Oliver also discovers a shocking secret that changes his perception of his life along the way ...but to find out what that is would require a read of this epic storyline. Jeff Lemire's story arc is luckily compiled into a single book titles "Green Arrow by Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino".
